**TL;DR:** In this tutorial, we’ll be learning how to use the [RxPy](https://rxpy.codeplex.com/) library to create asynchronous and event-based programs by implementing observables, observers/subscribers, and subjects. We will start by getting our data stream from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) with a [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org) web socket and then we will filter and process it asynchronously. [In this GitHub repository](https://github.com/valerybriz/RxGithubSearcher), you can find the code we will be using for this tutorial.

## Why Reactive Programming?

In a way, reactive programming isn't a new thing. Our typical click events are an asynchronous data stream which we can observe and trigger actions from it. That's how it works, but Reactive Programming makes things so much easier by adding a toolbox of operators to filter, create, transform, and unify any of those streams. In just a few lines of maintainable code, we can have web sockets that receive multiple requests and handle them on an asynchronous process that serves a filtered output.

Web applications contains lots of database operations, network calls, nested callbacks, and other computationally expensive tasks that might take a long time to complete (or even block other threads until it's done). This is where Reactive Programming enters, it gives us the facility to convert almost anything to streams (like variables, properties, user inputs, caches, etc) to manage it asynchronously. Besides that, it also gives us an easy way to handle errors. Task that is usually hard task within asynchronous programming. Reactive Programming makes our code more flexible, readable, maintainable, and easy to write.

## What Does Reactive Programming Really Means?

The main difference between [Event-Driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) and Reactive Programming is the real trigger of the action. While the Event-Driven programming focuses on handling any event (such as a button click) to trigger the corresponding action, Reactive Programming wraps data into the reactive system as events. This enables us to do things like like listening to user inputs as events that triggers an action only if the input changed from the previous one.

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Reactive, in Reactive Programming, means a dynamic reaction to change in streams." %}

Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. This means that, when a data flow is emitted by one component, the Reactive Programming library will automatically propagate those changes to other components until it reaches the final receiver.

## What Does Reactive Programming Works?

Let's take into consideration [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/), the most famous implementation of the Reactive Programming paradigm. ReactiveX is mainly based in two classes: the `Observable` and `Observer` classes. The `Observable` class is the source of data streams or events and the `Observer` class is the one that consumes (or reacts to) the emitted elements.

### Observables in Reactive Programming

An `Observable` packs the incoming data so it can be passed from one thread to another. The `Observable` can be configured so it regulates when to supply data. For example, it could be triggered periodically or only once in their life cycle. There are also various functions that can be used to filter or transform the observable so the observer only emits certain data. All this is used instead of callbacks, which means that our code becomes more readable and less fallible.

```python
from rx import Observable, Observer

source = Observable.from_list([1,2,3,4,5,6])
```

It’s common to use `Observables` in a way that it doesn’t give data until some `Observer` subscribes to it. Known as ["call by need"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_need), this is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an event until its value is needed.

### Observers in Reactive Programming

The `Observer` consumes the data stream emitted by the `Observable`. An `Observable` can have multiple `Observers` so each data item emitted will be received by each `Observer`. The "listening" to the stream is called subscribing. `Observers` subscribe to the `Observable` with the `subscribe()` method to receive the emitted data.

The `Observer` can receive three types of events:

* **on_next()**: when there is an element in the data stream;
* **on_completed()**: when no more items are coming, it implies end of emission.
* **on_error()**: when there is an error thrown from the `Observable` (it also implies end of emission);

```python
class PrintObserver(Observer):

    def on_next(self, value):
        print("Received {0}".format(value))

    def on_completed(self):
        print("Done!")

    def on_error(self, error):
        print("Error Occurred: {0}".format(error))

source.subscribe(PrintObserver())
```

We don't have to specify all three event types in the code. We can choose which events to observe using the named arguments, or simply providing a lambda for the `on_next` function. Typically, in production, we will want to provide an `on_error` handler so errors are explicitly handled by the subscriber.

```python
source = Observable.from_list([1,2,3,4,5,6])

source.subscribe(lambda value: print("Received {0}".format(value)))
```

### Subjects in Reactive Programming

The `Subject` is the `Observable` extension that simultaneously implements the `Observer` interface. That is, `Subjects` acts like both `Observers` and `Observables`. They receive messages about events (like `Observers`) and notify their subscribers (like `Observables`). This implies two things:

* We can subscribe to a `Subject`, just like an `Observ­able`.
* A `Sub­ject` can sub­scribe to other `Observables`.

Therefore, the main dif­fer­ence between a `Sub­ject` and an `Observable` is that all of the `Sub­ject` subscribers share the same action. This means that, when a `Sub­ject` pro­duces data, all of its sub­scribers will receive the same data. This is unlike `Observ­ables`, where each sub­scrip­tion causes an inde­pen­dent exe­cu­tion of the observable.

A `Subscriber` can not only subscribe to an `Observable` but also unsubscribe from it. It is important to remember to unsubscribe from the asynchronous calls. When calling `unsubscribe()`, all the operators unsubscribe from one another in sequence from top to bottom. So we can avoid memory leaks. In the case of the `Subjects`, we will use the `dispose` method which can be thought of as the subscription itself, or perhaps a token representing the subscription. Disposing it will dispose the subscription and also unsubscribe. The unsubscribe call can be placed in the socket `on_close()` method:

```python
def on_close(self):
    self.combine_latest_sbs.dispose()
    print("WebSocket closed")
```

### Data Operators in Reactive Programming

The essence of Reactive Programmingis working with streams. As we saw before, we have an `Observable` class that supplies the data stream and an `Observer` which consumes it. But, along the way from the `Observable` to the subscriber, we can apply many `Operators` to the stream. These `Operators` define how and when the `Observables` should emit streams.

Most `Operators` execute a function on an `Observable` and return an `Observable`. So we can apply these operators one after the other, in a chain. Each operator in the chain modifies the `Observable` that results from the operation of the previous operator.

There are plenty of operators available. We will be exploring only the ones that we use for this tutorial. The operators can be classified by categories of their utility as:

* Creating Observables
* Transforming Observables
* Filtering Observables
* Combining Observables
* Error Handling Operators
* Observable Utility Operators
* Conditional and Boolean Operators
* Mathematical and Aggregate Operators
* Connectable Observable Operators

#### **Creating Observables Category**

The `just()` operator, as the name suggest, emits `Observables` with the same values provided in the arguments.

![Just operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/just.png)

As we can see in the following example, our `Observable` just emits `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` one after another:

```python
Observable.just(a,b,c,d)
```

The `interval()` operator creates an `Observable` that emits a sequence of integers spaced by a given time interval.

![Interval operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/interval.png)

For example, the following `Observable` refreshes the value every 60 Seconds for periodic updates:

```python
Observable.interval(60000)
```

#### **Filtering Observables Category**

The `filter()` operator emits only those items from an `Observable` that pass a predicate test.

![ Filter operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/filter.png)

In the following example, we are filtering by the text size so it emits only the strings that exceed a length of 2 characters.

```python
Subject.filter( lambda text: not text or len(text) > 2 )
```

The `throttle_last()` operator emits the most recent items emitted by an `Observable` within periodic time intervals.

![ ThrottleLast operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/throttlelast.png)

For example, to get the last value in a given time interval we could use RxPy as follows:

```python
Subject.throttle_last( 1000 )
```

#### **Transforming Observables Category**

The `flat_map()` operator transforms the items emitted by an `Observable` into `Observables`, then flatten the emissions from those into a single `Observable`.

![Flat_Map operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/flat_map.png)

Here we get the repositories information by the user input which is the name of the organization repository. As you can see, we are calling a `from_future()` observable, since we use an asynchronous tornado web socket to request the API information.

```python
Subject.flat_map( lambda name: Observable.from_future(self.get_org_repos(name)) )
```

#### **Observable Utility Operators Category**

The `do_action()` operator registers an action to take upon a variety of `Observable` lifecycle events.

![ Do_action operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/do_action.png)

Here we call the `send_response` function for each item in the data stream.

```python
Subject.do_action( lambda x: send_response('clear') )
```

#### **Combining Observables Category**

The `combine_latest()` operator combines, when an item is emitted by either of two `Observables`, the latest item emitted by each `Observable` via a specified function and emit items based on the results of this function.

![Combine_lastest operator marble diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/rxpy/combine_lastest.png)

Here we combine an interval `Observable` which will be sending the last input of the user every 60 seconds and the `input_value` `Observable` itself which will be emitted every time it changes:

```python
user_input.combine_latest( interval_observable, lambda input_value, i: input_value )
```

## Advantages of Reactive Programming

With Reactive Programming we can raise the level of abstraction of our code so we can focus on the interdependence of events that define the business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with a large amount of implementation details. With the help of the functional programming the code will also be more concise.

We can use Reactive Programming to process asynchronous incoming data—perhaps tasks with a lot of user interaction (clicks, gestures, etc.)—or processing system events (sensors, gyroscope, etc.). That is, we can use with all kind of interactions where the events are portrayed as the object states. Such an approach allows better dynamic process description, also simplifying the asynchronous code writing. Finally, we've got a best performance by the asynchronous context and the parallel processing of the data streams.

## Building an App with RxPy

First of all, we need to setup our environment by installing all the requirements we need to get our reactive web socket working. To do that on an easier and more organized way we are going to use [PipEnv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) Pipenv is a dependency manager that isolates projects on private environments, replacing pip and allowing us to install only what we really need for a certain project. PipEnv will easily manage the environment and the libraries we need to install.

```bash
pip install pipenv

```
Now we have to create the new environment by executing the following commands:

```bash
# create our project directory and move to it
mkdir rxtornado && cd rxtornado

# run pipenv to create a Python 3 (--three) virtualenv for our project
pipenv --three

# install the dependencies we need
pipenv install tornado rx pycurl

```
Once we execute this commands we can find two new files created on our project's root directory:

* Pipfile, a file that contains details about our project, like the Python version that we are using and the packages that our project needs.
* Pipenv.lock, a file that contains exactly what version of each package our project depends on, and its transitive dependencies.

Now that we are ready with the environment, we need to create a file called config.py which will contain the constants like the adress of the organizations we will be searching for in Github and also the TOKEN to use the Github API, we would have to replace the <TOKEN> with our own TOKEN, to get it we need to follow the instructions on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).

```python
TOKEN = <TOKEN>
headers = {'Content-Type' : 'application/json' } #get the content in json format
headers["Authorization"] = "token " + TOKEN #authentication for github
GITHUB_API_URL = "https://api.github.com"
orgs = ["/twitter/repos", "/auth0/repos", "/nasa/repos", "/mozilla/repos", "/adobe/repos"]
```

After that, we need to create a file called server.py which will contain the main code for the project, for this code we need to import certain modules from the libraries we just got installed:

```python
from rx import Observable
from rx.subjects import Subject
from tornado import ioloop
from tornado.escape import json_decode
from tornado.httpclient import AsyncHTTPClient
from tornado.web import Application, RequestHandler, StaticFileHandler, url
from tornado.websocket import WebSocketHandler
```

Here we have imported the `Observable` and `Subject` modules from the RxPy library and the `async` and `websocket` modules from Tornado to handle the requests.

It is important to notice that, to use the GitHub API authentication, we need to configure the Tornado HttpClient as a curl async client with the following line right after the imported libraries:

```python
AsyncHTTPClient.configure("tornado.curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient")
```
We also need to initialize our headers and the organizations adress we already declare on the config file.

```python
headers = conf.headers
GIT_ORG = conf.GITHUB_API_URL+"/orgs"
```
### Building the WebSocketHandler

Our application will exchange messages with a browser using web sockets. Web sockets allow a bidirectional communication between the browser and server in real time. The main idea is to define a class inherited from the `WebSocketHandler` class. We can find more information about Tornado WebSockets [here](http://www.tornadoweb.org).

Let's define the WebSocketHandler class with the following code:

```python
class WSHandler(WebSocketHandler):
    orgs = conf.orgs

    def check_origin(self, origin):
	#Override to enable support for allowing alternate origins.
        return True
```
Here we are initializing the organizations names and defining the origin check, which we can override if we need support for alternate origins.

### Obtaining Data

To obtain the data from the GitHub API, first we need to define a function inside our WebSocketHandler. This function will create an asynchronous `http_client` which will take the organization names received and return the requested repository information asynchronously as a response.

```python
def get_org_repos(self,org):
    """request the repos to the GitHub API"""
    http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
    response = http_client.fetch(GIT_ORG + org, headers=headers, method="GET")
    return response
```

In our implementation of the WebSocketHandler class, we will override the following methods:

* `on_message()`: This functon will be called when there is an incoming message on the web socket. As our response is formatted as JSON objects, we have to decode it and then push it to the `Subject` with the `on_next()` operator.
* `on_close()`: This function will be called once we close the web socket. As we read before, it is very important to unsubscribe the `Observable` once the operation has been terminated to avoid memory leaks. As such, in this method we are going to use the `dispose()` method.
* `open()`: This function will be called when the web socket is opened for the first time.

Inside the `open()` method, we are also going to define the methods `send_response()` and `on_error()` to handle this two kinds of events. In this case, we are printing the message or the exception on the log.

```python

def on_message(self, message):
    obj = json_decode(message)
    self.subject.on_next(obj['term'])

def on_close(self):
    # Unsubscribe from observable
    #  will stop the work of all observable
    self.combine_latest_sbs.dispose()
    print("WebSocket closed")

def open(self):
    print("WebSocket opened")
    self.write_message("connection opened")

    def send_response(x):
        self.write_message(json.dumps(x))

    def on_error(ex):
        print(ex)

    self.subject = Subject()

    user_input = self.subject.throttle_last(
        1000  # Given the last value in a given time interval
    ).start_with(
        ''  # Immediately after the subscription sends the default value
    ).filter(
        lambda text: not text or len(text) > 2
    )

    interval_obs = Observable.interval(
        60000  #refresh the value every 60 Seconds for periodic updates
    ).start_with(0)

    self.combine_latest_sbs = user_input.combine_latest(
        interval_obs, lambda input_val, i: input_val
    ).do_action(
        lambda x: send_response('clear')
    ).flat_map(
        self.get_data
    ).subscribe(send_response, on_error)

```

Once the data stream has been excited by the `on_message()` method, we are going to filter the incoming user input by the size of the string. So only inputs with a length higher than 2 characters are going to be emitted.

After that, we are going to create an interval `Observable` which will help us to "refresh" the input every 60 seconds and push this input again to the Subject.

Finally, we will combine both the interval Observable and the input value Subject so when either of it has a change it will be emitting a Subject to the chain. The chain will send it to the `send_response` method and then to the `get_data` method to be filtered and showed as the result.

### Filtering Incoming Data
To get the data filtered we are going to use a chain of Observable maps which are going to take the query (the user input) and evaluate it acording to the requirements we have set.

First we need to create the `get_info` method inside the WebSocketHandler class with the following:
```python
def get_info(self,req):
    """managing error codes and returning a list of json with content"""
    if req.code ==200:
        jsresponse = json.loads(req.body)
        return jsresponse
    elif req.code == 403:
        print("403 error")
        jsresponse = json.loads(req.body)
        return json.dumps("clear")
    else:
        return json.dumps("failed")

```
This method will help us to handle the exceptions of the request or if everything's ok (code == 200) we will get a json formatted response with the information.

Now we create the get_data method also inside the WebSocketHandler class with:

```python
def get_data(self,query):
    """ query the data to the API and return the contet filtered"""
    return Observable.from_list(
        self.orgs
    ).flat_map(
        lambda name: Observable.from_future(self.get_org_repos(name))
    ).flat_map(
        lambda x: Observable.from_list(

            self.get_info(x) #transform the response to a json list

         ).filter(

            lambda val: (val.get("description") is not None
		and (val.get("description").lower()).find(query.lower())!= -1)
            	or (val.get("language") is not None
            	and (val.get("language").lower()).find(query.lower())!= -1)
         ).take(10)  #just take 10 repos from each org

    ).map(lambda x: {'name': x.get("name"),
	'stars': str(x.get("stargazers_count")),
	'link': x.get("svn_url"),'description': x.get("description"),
	'language': x.get("language")})
```
First we are going to iterate by the organizations list defined on the config file. We get the organization repository information and then transform the response to the desirable format with the get_info method. After that we are making the query to the information we just got and take only the first 10 results that acomplish with this query. Finally we emit the Observable as a dictionary with the characteristics we will be showing in the page as a result.

Finally we need to initialize and start the ioLoop for the web socket and render the `index.html` page which is going to show the results of the request with the following code:

```python
class MainHandler(RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.render("index.html")

def main():
    port = os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)
    app = Application([
        url(r"/", MainHandler),
        (r'/ws', WSHandler),
        (r'/static/(.*)', StaticFileHandler, {'path': "."})
    ])
    print("Starting server at port: %s" % port)
    app.listen(port)
    ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Here we are starting the web socket so it can listen on port 8080.
We can check the entire code of the server.py [here](https://github.com/valerybriz/RxGithubSearcher/blob/master/server.py)

### Showing the results on the page

To show the results we are using two static files which will be index.html and feeder.js.
Let's replace the content of the index.html with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" >
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="description" content="">
  <meta name="author" content="">
  <title>Github Searcher</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Github Repositories Searcher with RxPY</h1>
        <p class="lead">You are searching repositories from Auth0, Mozilla, Adobe, Twitter and Nasa</p>
      </div>
      <form role="form">
        <div class="form-group">
          <label for="textInput">Enter keywords or a programming language to search on the repos</label>
          <input type="text" id="textInput" class="form-control" placeholder="Query...">
        </div>
      </form>
      <ul id="results"></ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"></script>
  <script src="static/feeder.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

```
As you can see, we will be replacing the <ul id="results"></ul> with the results of the request to the Github API dinamically.

And let's replace the content of the feeder.js with:
```javascript
(function (global, $, undefined) {
    function main() {
        var $input = $('#textInput'),
            $results = $('#results');
        var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/ws");

        $input.keyup(function(ev) {
            var msg = { term: ev.target.value };
            ws.send(JSON.stringify(msg));
        });
	ws.onmessage = function(msg) {
	    var value = JSON.parse(msg.data);
	    if (value === "clear") {$results.empty(); return;}
		    $('<li><h3><a tabindex="-1" href="' + value.link +
		        '">' + value.name +'</a></h3> <p> Description : '
			+ value.description +
		        '</p><p> Language : ' + value.language +
		        '</p><p> Stars : ' + value.stars + '</p></li>'
		    ).appendTo($results);
		    $results.show();
	}
    }
    main();
}(window, jQuery));

```
There you go!
Now to run it we just execute the server.py file and the app will be served at http://localhost:8080.

## Conclusions

Apps and systems nowadays have a lot of real-time computationally expensive events that enables a highly interactive experience to the user. Here is where ReactiveX shows up to help us properly dealing with that. And also with the help of the ReactiveX operators, we can not only manage this events but filter, unify and transform it on a inherent declarative style way.
I hope this serves as a useful introduction to ReactiveX and an overview of its basic capabilities. It also has much more powerful tools. To learn more about ReactiveX I encourage you to browse the resources available at [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io).

Thanks for reading.
